## API Documentation

[View Tesla JSON API Documentation](http://docs.timdorr.apiary.io/)

This is unofficial documentation of the Tesla JSON API used by the iOS and Android apps, as well as many 3rd party apps such as [VisibleTesla](http://visibletesla.com/). The API provides functionality to monitor and control the Model S, Model X, and future Tesla vehicles remotely.

This project provides a [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tesla/) library for accessing it.
